I’m a web developer with a strong focus on building real, usable projects — from full hotel booking systems in PHP/MySQL to modern JavaScript-based applications and AI/ML-powered tools.

🔹 **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, Angular, Bootstrap, jQuery  
🔹 **Back-End:** PHP, MySQL, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, MongoDB, PostgreSQL  
🔹 **Other Tools:** Python, Flask, Hardhat, Git, GitLab, Jira, Confluence

I enjoy solving practical problems — whether it’s automating tasks, handling data, or building tools that feel good to use.
